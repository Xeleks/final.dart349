    <article class="tr t11">Hey missy! I wanted to talk to you about something. Don‚Äôt be mad, I'm just passing the
      message. The salads that you're making don‚Äôt exactly correspond to our customers‚Äô standards. You're adding too
      much dressing, the plate looks like a mess, and there‚Äôs not enough for the portion that we‚Äôre offering. I didn‚Äôt
      mention it until now but it's time to get yourself together.

    </article>
    <article class="tl t12">Were there any complaints from our clients?
    </article>
    <article class="tr t13">No but the managers were giving me an earful that our food doesn‚Äôt look or taste the way
      it's supposed to. Also they said it took too much time to make a simple salad. Next time it happens they'll ask to
      redo the entire order before sending it out.

    </article>
    <article class="tl t14">Okay, so they want me to make it quickly, the salad that has about 12 different ingredients
      in it, and to redo them if it doesn't meet the standards. Isn‚Äôt that punishment also reflecting on our customers
      waiting to just eat??

    </article>
    <article class="tr t15">The person that worked on it before you was doing it just fine though.
    </article>
    <article class="tl t16">Okay‚Ä¶? I was working on the same task from the very beginning. AND I was exceling at it. Why
      did they suddenly decide
      to switch my position to salad station?


    </article>
    <article class="tr t17"> Someone has to do it. And as we all know youre great with multitasking. Why are you so
      reluctant about it? Making a salad is literally the
      easiest thing to do on the menu.

    </article>
    <article class="tl t18 box"> You call that easy just because it's a salad? <p>Why can‚Äôt YOU do it then?</p>

      <p>To make that salad you need to prep all those ingredients, organize them in order to speed up the process,
        plate it, and try to make it work perfectly on a tiny plate.

    <article class="tr t19 box2">No thank you üòÅ. You got this!!
      <p>xoxo</p>
      <p>Honestly though, this is the most dreadful spot, that's why no one agrees to work on that task. And since salad
        is one of our most popular dishes, you can focus on doing this one task and learn it to the last detail. We
        figured we‚Äôd give it to you based on your lack of experience.</p>

      <p>Union dues can cost workers a lot of money each year, ranging from $200 to several hundred dollars. Not all
        workers in a union have to pay these dues, though. Those who do are essentially giving up a portion of their pay
        to be part of the union, which can be around 2.5% of their salary for some unions. On top of that, there are
        other fees like yearly fees, initiation fees, and more that can add up over time.
