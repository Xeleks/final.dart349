            <h1> Welcome.</h1>You have to respect your employees. Not only does everyone deserve proper treatment
            regarding their ethnicity, gender and personality, but also a proper compensation when an employee shows
            potential, hard work and loyalty providing benefits to their workspace.
            </p>
            <p>This is a playful take on the unfair terms some of us had or could experience as an employee. Either
                being a minimum wage worker for a retail store, a coworker working at a restaurant on a tip based
                salary, or as a freelancer dealing with the absurdity of their clients.

                <h3>Scenario: John D. [Your Friendly Manager]</h3>
                <h4>Setting: A Regular Retail Store</h4>Despite employees' rights, some employers and higher ups find
                gray zones/ loopholes that
                allow them to lower someone’s worth without getting in trouble with the law. Using manipulation, gas
                lighting, threats and guilt tripping actions into loyalty of their workers. And not everyone can afford
                losing their position as it’s their only source of income. Some examples can be seen with
                waiters/waitresses, retail stores, minimum-wage workers, part-time students, intern stages, newly
                employed, or even those who had been working in the same environment for a long period of time.</p>

                <h3>Scenario: Missy C. [Young Coworker]</h3>
                <h4>Setting: Working At A Restaurant</h4>Colleagues can choose to combine tips. One can also opt to
                share them with other employees in the workplace. However, the employer cannot force an employee to
                share tips with others or set up a voluntary tipping pool. If a tip-sharing plan is established, it must
                be mutually agreed upon by all workers involved. Yet sometimes, employers do find a way to turn that
                option into a rule without making it feel wrong.

                <h3>Scenario: Dweet F. [A customer you'll probably see once]</h3>
                <h4>Setting: Dealing with clients as a Designer</h4>Dealing with clients can become troublesome. Many
                don’t understand the work designers put into their fictional work. Sometimes, their minds go out of
                bounds, and it's their job to either meet their requirements to achieve clients’ satisfaction or push
                them towards a simpler solution that also works. The important part is to stand their ground and charge
                extra for extra time they need to ‘fix’ the layout based on clients suggestions. Their demands can
                become absurd, it's a designer’s job to make their dream design realistic based on the budget they
                offer.</p>
