    <article class="tl t9 box">Ok so for the logo: I’d like it creative. Make it iconic.
      Picture a website for a gaming company that's aiming for sophistication but ends up with a few twist and turns.
      First off, let's talk colors. Instead of sleek blacks and vibrant accents, let's go with neon green, fiery orange,
      and electric purple. Now, onto the multimedia. How about a homepage with a video background? But instead of epic
      game trailers, let's throw in some old-school pixel art animations of... I don't know, dancing cats or flying
      tacos. And let's add some quirky sound effects, like retro game bleeps and bloops that play randomly when you
      click around. And all that added to the home page, then, Instead of a straightforward menu, let's have users
      navigate through a virtual game world, where they have to explore different levels or areas to find what they're
      looking for. Can you create this blend of sophistication and gaming quirkiness for our website? Same
      specifications for the poster, oh and we’ll need a QR code.

    </article>
    <article class="tr t11 ">How about we take some things off? To make it a little…simpler? Add a bit of whitespace?
    </article>
    <article class="tl t12">Nah we need to attract the eye. No simplicity. I don't know just make it pop. I trust your creativity. Should be simple right? How much time will you need to make that happen?

    </article>
    <article class="tr t13">For the website only? 5 years. </article>
      <article class="tl t14">How about 5 weeks?
  
      </article>
      <article class="tr t15">Realistically? No.

    <article class="tl t12">All of em.
    </article>
    <article class="tr t13">That will cost extra. </article>
      <article class="tl t14">That literally takes 5 min to do, can’t you do it for free? I could almost do it myself

      <article class="tr t15">This isn't the word Docx Dweet. Besides, if it were 10 pages it would've been fine, you have 102.
